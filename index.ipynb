    "This course provides an introduction to Python programming for geoscientists. It was developed and delivered at the [Research School of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au), [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) between 2018 and 2020 by Oscar Branson, Charles Le Losq, Rebecaa McGirr and Andrew Valentine.\n",

    "## Format\n",
    "The course was designed to be taught intensively, with ~45 timetabled hours over 3 weeks. Apart from an [introductory presentation](Slides/slides.pdf), which introduces some basic concepts of computer science, the course is mainly built around self-paced practical exercises. Students completed these in class time, with support from teaching staff, and with regular whole-class discussion/presentation of concepts and particular exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, students were able to move forward at a rate of about one practical per 2-3 hour session. Unsurprisingly, there is wide variation across students and across practicals. Students were advised that only material from practicals 1-16 was examinable; practicals 17-20 introduce some more advanced topics. Exercise 11 can be skipped if students are pressed for time.\n",
